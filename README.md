Canadian GST/HST/PST Calculator
===============================

biz.jmaconsulting.cdntaxcalculator

This is a one-off implementation of Canadian Sales Taxes. It hardcodes some things for a particular site such as catalog items and delivery charges, but uses a generalized set of taxes by province and territory.

Place of supply for the purposes of tax calculation is the billing address which is also used for delivery of goods.

There is no support for place of supply for events to be determined based on location of event venue and/or billing address based on whether the event is offline or online.

There is no support for place of supply for memberships to be determined based on location of billing address.
